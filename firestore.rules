/**
 * @file Firestore Security Rules for Saima Villas Community App
 * @version 2
 *
 * @Core Philosophy: This ruleset provides public read access to most data while restricting write access based on pre-approved roles or credentials.
 *
 * @Data Structure:
 * - /villas/{villaId}: Publicly readable villa information.
 * - /advertisements/{advertisementId}: Publicly readable advertisements; creation requires an approved phone number.
 * - /managementPosts/{managementPostId}: Publicly readable posts from management; creation requires a management password.
 * - /complaints/{complaintId}: Publicly readable complaints; creation requires an approved phone number, resolution requires a management password.
 * - /emergencyContacts/{emergencyContactId}: Publicly readable emergency contact information; creation requires an approved phone number.
 * - /approvedPhones/{approvedPhoneId}: List of approved phone numbers; write-restricted to prevent unauthorized ad creation.
 * - /managementPasswords/{managementPasswordId}: List of management passwords; write-restricted to prevent unauthorized management actions.
 * - /martStatus/{martStatusId}: Publicly readable mart status; write-restricted to prevent unauthorized status changes.
 * - /namazTimings/{timingId}: Publicly readable prayer timings.
 *
 * @Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public Read Access: Villas, advertisements, management posts, complaints, emergency contacts, mart status, and prayer timings are all publicly readable, even by unauthenticated users.
 * - Role-Based Writes: Advertisement, Complaint, and EmergencyContact creation are controlled by the presence of a phone number in the /approvedPhones collection. ManagementPost creation and Complaint resolution are controlled by the presence of a valid management password in the /managementPasswords collection.
 * - Denormalization for Authorization: The approvedPhones and managementPasswords collections act as denormalized role stores, enabling fast existence checks during write operations without the need for costly or impossible queries.
